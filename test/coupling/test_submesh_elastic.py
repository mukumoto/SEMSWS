"""
ParSubMesh elastic regression: with --no-coupling + source + receiver both
inside the SOLID submesh, the recorded solid DISP-z trace must show the
P-wave direct arrival at the geometric expected time (distance / vp_solid +
Ricker delay), within a small tolerance.

The existing pure-solid waveform tests under test/waveform/3D/elastic/ run
on a FULL ParMesh with material.type=isotropic_elastic. They do not
exercise the same elastic solver path we hit inside the coupled facade,
which wraps it in a ParSubMesh extracted from a two-attribute parent mesh.
If ParSubMesh-specific regressions slip in (face-DOF orientation, element
numbering, source location resolution, boundary detection), that code path
silently gives wrong waveforms on R03-style deep-solid receivers while the
full-ParMesh pure-solid test stays green.

Catch: this test is tighter than test_coupling_cross_domain.py's
"peak > 1.0" amplitude gate. We check the arrival TIME of the direct P wave
to within a small fraction of a Ricker period — enough to catch the
80 ms error mode we saw in the SPECFEM3D benchmark.
