"""
Phase 4 smoke test: Cerjan absorbing boundaries in the coupled facade
are WIRED UP and reach the per-submesh operators.

The coupled-material YAML supports `boundary.absorbing.sides/thickness/alpha`
and each sub-operator (fluid acoustic / solid elastic) must receive a
DampingConfig that is filtered to the attributes actually present on
its own submesh. This test exercises the full path and asserts:

1. Simulation with Cerjan enabled completes without abort and produces
   a finite, non-zero fluid receiver trace.
2. Cerjan-on and Cerjan-off produce DIFFERENT traces; the sponge is
   doing something, not silently no-op'ing (which would be the failure
   mode when the attr/name mapping isn't right, as happened with the
   default lumped-bdr mesh + name-based sides).

The *quantitative* physics of Cerjan absorption (how much reverb is
actually killed, how flat the transmitted pulse gets) depends heavily
on sponge thickness vs. wavelength and on α tuning; in this bounded-
domain test it's too noisy to pin down a stable tolerance. The
quantitative validation of absorbing behavior moves to the SPECFEM3D
reference comparison (Phase 5) where both codes share the same geometry
and source-time function.
